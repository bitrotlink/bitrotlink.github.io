<h2>Delusion Saving Time</h2>
<p style="font-size:smaller;">2023 March 20th, the northern spring equinox</p><br>

<p>Let's get one thing out of the way: You can't alter celestial mechanics by pressing buttons on your clock. No matter what your clock says, it has no effect on how much daylight you have at various times of the year, and no effect on when in the morning and afternoon that daylight occurs. Daylight Saving Time is a lie.</p>

<p>What you <i>can</i> do is spread the lie, and try to sow confusion by conscripting a totally different issue into your demagoguery. That other issue is the perfectly reasonable question of whether to go to work in the morning at the same time in summer and winter, or go an hour earlier in summer. Since you have more summer daylight in both the morning and afternoon, you can either use it as-is, or go to work earlier, thus sacrificing some of the extra pre-work daylight in exchange for even more post-work daylight. This choice exists regardless of what your clock says. If you go to work at 8:00 in the winter and 7:00 in the summer, then claiming that you go to work at 8:00 in the summer accomplishes nothing.</p>

<p>For liars, there's a third issue. This is the despicable question of whether to lie for 8 months per year, from mid-March to mid-November, and tell the truth for 4 months, or instead simply lie all year round. But for honest people, there's no such issue. Simply tell the truth all year round.</p>

<p>Naturally, the liars deny that DST is a lie. For the case of lying for only 2/3 of the year, the lie is obvious. But the case of lying all year round is more insidious, because the lack of contrast enables a constant lie to be more easily mistaken for the truth. To see through the snow job, it's first necessary to really understand why we have time zones.</p>

<h4>Time zones</h4>

<p>Standardizing time in a local area is a practical necessity for coordinating our activities. Since noon is a function of longitude, standardizing time has the consequence that only clocks on the reference meridian will indicate noon when the time is actually noon (mean solar noon specifically); all other nearby clocks will indicate noon a few seconds or minutes before or after noon. This is a necessary tradeoff.</p>

<p>But what about places far from the reference meridian? One solution would be to use the same time worldwide, indicating 12:00 at noon at a global reference meridian, and indicating 0:00 at noon on the opposite side of Earth. So, if London starts its work day at 8:00 and ends at 17:00, then New York City starts at 13:00 and ends at 22:00, and Los Angeles starts at 16:00 and ends at 1:00.</p>

<p>But we don't do that.</p>

<p>Instead, we divide Earth into 24 time zones, each with its center serving as the local reference meridian, offset an integer number of hours from GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), the standard alignment we chose in 1884. Clocks in each time zone indicate 12:00 when the time is noon at the zone's center. This enables a great benefit: clocks worldwide can indicate the same minutes and seconds, differing only by integer increments of hours, yet 12:00 for each clock anywhere in any time zone still remains within a half hour of noon. (Pedants might object because apparent solar noon varies with the equation of time, but we've compensated using mean solar time for 1900 years, since Ptolemy. And UTC instead of UT1 is likewise irrelevant here.)</p>

<p>Note that last point carefully: the entire purpose of time zones is <i>to keep 12:00 close to noon</i> even with global alignment. If we didn't mind noon being about 17:00 in NYC and 20:00 in LA, and 11:00 in Berlin, then we could dispense with time zones and just use GMT. But we do mind; that's the point. The standard of 12:00 for noon has been ingrained in our culture for the past 900 years, since Middle English.</p>

<p>This is why a year-round lie is still a lie, and doesn't become truth by virtue of being constant. Our standard time zone system has 12:00 in each zone when the time at the center is noon. It achieves this year-round, worldwide, and matches our cultural standard. But clocks set to DST indicate 13:00 at noon.</p>

<p>Remember Lincoln's question of how many legs a calf would have if you call its tail a leg. The correct answer is four. Calling noon 13:00 is as idiotic as calling a calf's tail a leg.</p>

<h4>Just a little white lie</h4>

<p>At this point, the liars will ask, what's wrong with a little white lie? After all, suppose we instead make a rational yet more drastic change: all clocks will use GMT from now on. In this case, people in LA won't start going to work at midnight, just because their clocks say 8:00 then. Instead, they'll compensate for the altered clocks, and continue going at their usual time in the morning, which will now be 16:00. Harmless!</p>

<p>To answer that question, remember that with DST, clocks are wrong by only one hour, so it's subtle. Unlike the clean-break case of worldwide GMT, DST is a facade of the local time zone, and people fail to compensate for the altered clocks. For example, when you've been at work for a few hours, you know the time is about mid-day, and the DST clocks say 12:00, it's all too easy to conclude that the time is noon, even though noon in your time zone is an hour in the future. <i>The entire purpose of DST is gaslighting.</i> The perpetrators don't even try to hide this fact; DST was invented specifically to manipulate people's behavior by manipulating their sense of time. It hijacks the well known fact that 12:00 is supposed to be noon, in order to warp people's perception of morning and afternoon.</p>

<p>The coercion is especially clever in America, where Congress makes DST nationally standard-but-optional, and individual States follow along since it's a national standard, so every legislator can evade responsibility for making DST no more optional than Social Security is and COVID-19 masks were.</p>

<p>If people go to work at 8:00 in the winter and 7:00 in the summer, or even go at 7:00 year-round as the permanent-DST advocates prefer, there's no need to lie about it. Even if you want to be a tyrant, you can just decree that everybody must go at 7:00. But lying about the time of day, and coercing everybody into affirming the lie â€” that's just pathological. So, it's no surprise that the U.S. Senate in 2022 didn't try to abolish this abomination, but instead unanimously tried to permanently <i>enshrine</i> it by passing the Newspeak-named <b>Sunshine&nbsp;Protection&nbsp;Act</b>, and is exhibiting that self-despicablization again this year. Even the Russians have more sense than this.</p>
<br>

<p>Therefore, we petition Congress to muster a rare moment of decency and pass a simple 20-word law, the&nbsp;<b>Truth&nbsp;Protection&nbsp;Act</b>:</p>

<blockquote style="font-size:larger;">All legislative and regulatory authorization to use Daylight Saving Time<br>
  in the United States and its territories is hereby repealed.</blockquote>
<br>

<h3>How to sign this petition?</h3>

<p>Do so by voice. Go to the <a href="https://www.acs.org/policy/memberadvocacy/find-a-legislator.html">Find Your Legislators</a> page.</p>

<p>Choose your State, then choose your U.S. House representative. There will be an office phone number listed. Call that number and ask for passage of the 20-word <b>Truth&nbsp;Protection&nbsp;Act</b> above. It will take less than ten seconds for you to read it aloud. Then do likewise with your U.S. senators.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll never get to talk to your congressmen. You'll talk to aides. But when aides receive many calls on a subject, they tell their bosses.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that they care <i>why</i> you want the law passed, you can explain on the phone, or just tell them to read this web page. You can also link this page in emails to your congressmen, but beware that's almost useless. It's easy for them to ignore thousands of signatures on a written petition, or thousands of names online, or thousands of email messages. It's much harder to ignore thousands of phone calls.</p>
