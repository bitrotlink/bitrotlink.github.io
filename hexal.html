    <h1>Hexal numerals and metric system</h1>

        <h4><i>World Metrology Day</i> — ໣໭'๥๴</h4>
  <h2>Hexal numerals</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The <i>hexal</i> numeral system is base ๡๠, i.e. base 60. It's also known as <i>εξηκονταδικές (hexikontadikes)</i> and <i>sexagesimal</i>.</p>

<p>The hexal digits are:<br>
๠ ๡ ๢ ๣ ๤ ๥ ๦ ๧ ๨ ๩ ๪ ๫ ๬ ๭ ๮ ๯ ๰ ๱ ๲ ๳ ๴ ๵ ๶ ๷ ๸ ๹ ๺ ๻ ๼ ๽ ໠ ໡ ໢ ໣ ໤ ໥ ໦ ໧ ໨ ໩ ໪ ໫ ໬ ໭ ໮ ໯ ໰ ໱ ໲ ໳ ໴ ໵ ໶ ໷ ໸ ໹ ໺ ໻ ໼ ໽<br>
with values 0 through 59, respectively.<br>
The glyphs ๰, ๵, ๶, and ໫ have serifs on the left to distinguish from the plus sign and the letters Y, X, and T.</p>

    <p>Analogous to 100 being pronounced “hundred” instead of “tenty” (the next decade after ninety) due to 100 being an integer power of the base in decimal, and likewise 1000 normally being pronounced “thousand” instead of “ten hundred”, so also hexal has names for the integer powers of the base. It also has names analogous to 0.1 being pronounced “one tenth”, 0.01 “one hundredth” or “one percent”, and so on for parts per thousand and per million.<p>
<p>The names are as follows:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>๡๠</td><td>one hesh</td><td>๠.๡</td><td>one perhesh</td></tr>
<tr><td>๡๠๠</td><td>one dihesh (“di” rhymes with “tee”)</td><td>๠.๠๡</td><td>one per dihesh</td></tr>
<tr><td>๡๠๠๠</td><td>one trihesh (“tri” is pronounced as “try”)</td><td>๠.๠๠๡</td><td>one per trihesh</td></tr>
<tr><td>๡๠ ๠๠๠</td><td>one tetresh</td><td>๠.๠๠๠ ๡</td><td>one per tetresh</td></tr>
<tr><td>๡๠๠ ๠๠๠</td><td>one pentesh</td><td>๠.๠๠๠ ๠๡</td><td>one per pentesh</td></tr>
</table>
<p>and so on for hexesh, heptesh, octesh, ennesh, decesh, hendecesh, dodecesh, tridecesh, tetradecesh, pendecesh, hexadecesh, heptadecesh, octodecesh, enneadecesh, icosesh.<br>
      The reason for “tri” being pronounced “try” instead of “tree” is to clearly distinguish it from “three”.
    </p>

<h4>Hexal positive exponent characters</h4>
  ໿ ࿸ ࿹ ࿺ ࿻ ࿼ ࿽ ࿾ ࿿<br>
  When suffixed to a numeral, they mean, respectively, ×๡๠<sup>๡</sup> through ×๡๠<sup>๩</sup>.
Exponents ๪ and greater don't have dedicated characters; instead, they're expressed using pairs of characters: the positive exponent marker <b>໾</b> and a digit. The pairs ໾๪ through ໾໽ mean ×๡๠<sup>๪</sup> through ×๡๠<sup>໽</sup>, respectively.

  <h4>Hexal negative exponent characters</h4>
  ๿ ࿰ ࿱ ࿲ ࿳ ࿴ ࿵ ࿶ ࿷<br>
    When suffixed to a numeral, they mean, respectively, ×๡๠<sup>-๡</sup> through ×๡๠<sup>-๩</sup>. Exponents -๪ and lower are expressed using the negative exponent marker <b>๾</b>. The pairs ๾๪ through ๾໽ mean ×๡๠<sup>-๪</sup> through ×๡๠<sup>-໽</sup>, respectively.</p>

    <p>Analogous to “10%” being pronounced “ten percent”, the same value in hexal is “๦๿” and is pronounced “six perhesh”.</p>

    <p>In decimal, 1000  = 1e3; both can be pronounced “one thousand”, or depending on preference or emphasis, the latter can instead be pronounced “one times ten raised three”. Likewise in hexal, ๡๠๠๠ = ๡࿹, and can be pronounced “one trihesh”, or the latter can be pronounced “one times hesh raised three”.</p>
<p></p>
  <h2>The Hexmet system</h2>
  <p>The Hexal metric system of units, <i>Hexmet</i>, is the system of units in which, exactly,
  <ul>
<li>the unperturbed ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the cesium-133 atom, ∆ν<sub>Cs</sub>, is 9 192 631 770 Hz</li>
<li>the speed of light in vacuum, c, is <b>๡๠๠ ๠๠๠ ᴘ</b>/s</li>
<li>the Planck constant, h, is 6.626 070 15 e-34 J·s</li>
<li>the elementary charge, e, is 1.602 176 634 e-19 C</li>
<li>the Boltzmann constant, k, is <b>273.16</b> × 1.380 649 e-23 J/<b>ᴛ</b></li>
<li>the Avogadro constant, N<sub>A</sub>, is 6.022 140 76 <b>e26/(299 792 458/๡๠ ๠๠๠)² 1/mel</b></li>
<li>the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 e12 Hz, K<sub>cd</sub>, is 683 lm/W</li>
</ul>
  where the hertz, joule, coulomb, lumen, and watt, with unit symbols Hz, J, C, lm, and W, respectively, are related to the units second, <b>pon</b>, <b>stone</b>, ampere, <b>thermab</b>, <b>mel</b>, and candela, with unit symbols s, <b>ᴘ</b>, <b>st</b>, A, <b>ᴛ</b>, <b>mel</b>, and cd, respectively, according to the following unit definitions:</p>
<p>Hz = 1/s<br>
  J = <b>st·ᴘ²</b>/s²<br>
  C = A·s<br>
  lm = cd·sr<br>
  W = <b>st·ᴘ²</b>/s³</p>

  <p>That text is adapted from the SI brochure, and Hexmet's differences from SI are in <b>bold</b>. The numerical values of the constants are expressed using a mix of decimal and hexal numerals to make clear the relationship between Hexmet and SI.</p>

  <h3>Hexmet and SI</h3>
    <p>The second, ampere, and candela are identical in both systems.</p>
    <h4>Length and mass</h4>
    <p>“Pon” rhymes with “zone”. The name is derived from πυγών, but simplified because native English speakers are unable to pronounce the original. This is an ancient Greek unit of length, from an adult's elbow to fist.</p>
    <p>The <i>stone</i> is so named because it's close to a historical unit of the same name.
<p><b>st·ᴘ² = kg·m²</b> exactly, due to the identical numerical value of the Planck constant in the unit <b>st·ᴘ²/s</b> and the unit <b>kg·m²/s</b>. Due to this, the joule, watt, volt, ohm, farad, henry, and weber are also identical in Hexmet and SI.</p>
<p>The decimal values of the Hexmet length and mass units in terms of SI units are approximately:<br>
1 ᴘ ≈ 0.38554 m<br>
1 st ≈ 6.72777 kg</p>

<h4>Amount of substance</h4>
    <p><b>d/mel = g/mol</b> exactly, where d = st/๡๠๠ and g = kg/1000.</p>
    <p>Hexmet's mel differs from SI's mole simply to compensate for the two systems' different mass units.</p>

    <h4>Temperature</h4>
    <p>The “ab” in “thermab” sounds like the first syllable of “absolute”.
    <p><b>1 ᴛ = 273.16 K</b> exactly. Both are absolute temperature scales, with zero being absolute zero; however, where SI defines the kelvin such that water's triple point temperature is 273.16 K (within the current limits of measurement), Hexmet defines the thermab such that water's triple point temperature is ๡ ᴛ, i.e. 1 ᴛ.</p>
      <p>This definition, combined with hexal as the numerical base, makes the thermab scale convenient for anthropocentric temperatures, eliminating the need for a separate convenience scale, as Celsius is needed for Kelvin.</p>
      <p>Water's freezing temperature at atmospheric pressure is practically ๡ ᴛ, room temperature is ๡.๥ ᴛ, human body temperature is ๡.๨ ᴛ, and water's boiling temperature is ๡.๶ ᴛ. Two fractional figures, e.g. ๡.๥๠, give finer precision than decidegrees Celsius, which is finer than necessary for everyday use, and exceeds the precision of common digital temperature sensors</p>
    <p>For temperatures greater than or equal to ๠.໠ ᴛ (i.e. 0.5 ᴛ), which is far below Earth's lowest recorded surface temperature, and less than ๡.໠ ᴛ (i.e. 1.5  ᴛ), which exceeds water's boiling point at atmospheric pressure, temperatures can be expressed in complement form for brevity, such as on surface temperature charts: the unit digit (in these cases, always ๠ or ๡), radix point, and unit symbol are omitted, and temperatures are expressed as simply two digits, with ໠๠ ≤ n &lt; ๡๠๠ implying unit digit ๠, and ๠ ≤ n &lt; ໠๠ implying unit digit ๡.</p>
    <p>Converting between literal and complement form, which are two expressions of the same absolute scale, is trivial, requiring just omitting or restoring the unit digit. This contrasts to conversion between the Kelvin absolute scale and Celsius convenience scale, which requires adding or subtracting 273.15. For temperatures outside the range ๠.໠ ᴛ ≤ n &lt; ๡.໠ ᴛ, only literal form is used.</p>

    </p>


<h4>A metric system</h4>
  <p>In the same way that SI is metric when using the decimal numeral system, Hexmet is metric when using hexal.</p>

  <p>When hexal exponent characters are not suffixed to numerals, but instead prefixed to unit symbols, they serve as metric prefixes, analogous to SI prefixes k, M, G, m, μ, n. The same typographic spacing rules apply as for SI. For example, in SI:<br>
1000 m = 1e3 m = 1 km<br><br>
Likewise, in Hexmet:<br>
  ๡๠๠ ᴘ = ๡࿸ ᴘ = ๡ ࿸ᴘ</p>

    <p>Analogous to the series of number names “hesh”, “dihesh”, etc, the positive metric prefix names are “hes”, “dihes”, etc. For example, ๡ ࿸J is one dihesjoule, which is one watt-hour.</p>
      <p>Likewise, ๡ ࿸s is one dihesec (the trailing “ond” is truncated from “second” when a Hexmet prefix is applied), which is one hour.</p>
      <p>For distance, ๡ ࿸ᴘ is one dihesp (the trailing “on” is truncated from “pon” when a Hexmet prefix is applied). The dihesp is the common city-scale unit of distance; it's between one kilometer and one mile.</p>
    <p>Only the second and pon have their trailing letters truncated when a prefix as applied, due to the frequent use of these units. No other unit names are truncated when prefixed.</p>

    <p>The negative metric prefix names are: lus, dilus, trilus, tetrul, pentul, hexul, heptul, octul, ennul, decul, hendecul, dodecul, tridecul, tetradecul, pendecul, hexadecul, heptadecul, octodecul, enneadecul, icosul.</p> For example, one ๡ ๿ᴘ is one lusp (with the trailing “on” truncated from “pon”), and is about 1/4 inch.

<h4>Hexmet features</h4>
<p>Hexmet shares the two main advantages of SI: it's a metric system, meaning all the units are scaled just by shifting the radix point, and it's a coherent system, in the technical sense (the factor relating all the units is 1).</p>

    <p>Hexmet's unit of length, the pon, shares the main advantage of the imperial foot: divisibility by 3 using standard smaller units. Decimal, SI's native radix, coerces engieers to avoid thirds, in the same way that binary would coerce engineers to avoid fifths. Often, halves or quarters are appropriate substitutes, but sometimes thirds are ideal, and SI discourages them. All these systems do fail for sevenths and beyond, but fortunately those higher prime factors are much less often needed.</p>
<p></p>
    <h4>Advantages over both imperial and SI</h4>

    <p>Seconds, minutes, and hours are simply metrically scaled magnitudes of one another, due hexal being Hexmet's native radix.</p>

    <p>Using the pon, which is between a foot and a meter, and using Hexmet's standard long distance, the dihesp, which is between a kilometer and a mile, the speed unit for long distance and long time is the same as for short distance and short time. Unlike the need to convert ft/s, ft/min, and mi/hr or nmi/hr (knots), or convert m/s and km/hr, the Hexmet unit <i>pel</i> means both pon per second and dihesp per hour, as well as hesp per minute. Scaled units, e.g. pon per hour, are just radix point shifts of pel.</p>

<p>The pon is not only a mere radix point shift from the light-second, making it more convenient for engineering use than either the foot or meter, it also happens to be a more handy anthropocentric unit than either the foot or the meter, so much so that the ancient Greeks already named and used it, coincidentally to an accuracy better than one part per thousand, despite knowing nothing about light speed.</p>

    <p>The lusp, the next magnitude smaller than the pon, happens to be almost exactly 1/4 inch, within the tolerance for carpentry, and within the tolerance for the standard 1/4 inch drive used for small wrenches and sockets in both America and SI metric countries. This is because with base hexal, 1/4 inch happens to be almost exactly a metric magnitude of the light-second.</p>

<p>Decimal and SI, of course, have two overwhelming advantages: billions of people already know them, and countless records already use them. Because of this, Hexmet is designed to complement, not replace, decimal and SI. Hexal keeps both of decimal's prime factors, and just adds a third, and Hexmet keeps many of SI's units:</br>
second, ampere and coulomb, candela and lumen, joule and watt, volt, ohm, farad, henry, weber, and of course radian and steradian.</p>
