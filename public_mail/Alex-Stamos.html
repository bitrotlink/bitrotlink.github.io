<p>Mr. Stamos,</p>

<p>I'm writing to you because as CISO of Yahoo, you have authority to change an inappropriate security measure that Yahoo uses to grant access to its customers' email accounts. Yahoo has been improving some aspects of its email security over the past couple years, so I decided to wait before sending this message. But Yahoo remains unwilling to address the issues below.</p>

<p>http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/en-us/ section 3 says:<br>
⌜You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Yahoo! Service's registration form⌝.</p>

<p>The same page, section 5, says:<br>
⌜You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password⌝.<br>
But this is impossible to do while complying with the section-3 mandate to use public information as passwords.</p>

<p>You might dispute that the information required by section 3 is a password. But a password is exactly what it is. Consider Yahoo's ‟secret questions”, which as of June 29, 2013, are:</p>

<p>What is the first name of your favourite uncle?<br>
Where did you meet your spouse?<br>
What is your eldest cousin's name?<br>
What is your youngest child's nickname?<br>
What is your eldest child's nickname?<br>
What is the first name of your eldest niece?<br>
What is the first name of your eldest nephew?<br>
What is the first name of your favourite aunt?<br>
Where did you spend your honeymoon?</p>

<p>‟Claire” (no last name given) at your customer service informed me on June 14, 2013, that I violated your Terms of Service by lying about my eldest niece's name (see incident numbers <b>*redacted*</b> and <b>*redacted*</b> in your records), making it clear that section 3 of your TOS apply to your secret questions.</p>

<p>Regarding their use, you say during registration, ⌜the secret questions can help you get back into your account faster.⌝ Somewhere else, you say that the secret questions are for use in case users forget their passwords (I don't have an exact quote). However, my incident that began in June 2013 (ongoing, as my account <b>*redacted*</b> remains locked) shows that you sometimes demands entry of the answers to the secret questions even if users do not forget their passwords.</p>

<p>Now, remember what a password is: an answer which, if wrong, results in denial of access, and if right, results in granting of access. This is the function served by the answers to your secret questions, so calling them anything other than ‟passwords” only serves to confuse the issue. And your customer service gave the impression that a user's date of birth is also used for access authorization, even though DOB isn't one of the secret questions; that's further indication that the information required by section 3 is a password.</p>

<p>Obviously, it's unwise for anybody to use a password that can be obtained or reasonably guessed based on information about himself stored in third party databases, regardless of whether that information is public (since it's subject to being hacked), but especially if it is public or semi-public. Personal information used as a password is a security vulnerability. This fact has been demonstrated for many years with public hacking incidents, including high-profile ones involving Yahoo itself. Yet you continue to encourage your users to engage in such unwise behavior; just look at that list of secret questions above!</p>

<p>You apparently even require that unwise behavior, and penalize users such as myself who follow the advice of security practitioners to not use personal information as passwords. You say that prudence is against your TOS, you fail to acknowledge that your alternate passwords are in fact passwords, and you tell users during registration that the alternate passwords are for account recovery in case of loss of the primary password when in fact you might unexpectedly demand both the primary and alternate passwords years later, long after the user has forgotten the randomly-selected response entered for the express purpose of disabling the personal-information-based account recovery feature so the account wouldn't fall victim to the kinds of hacks that have been in the news. The latter is why I'm now locked out of my Yahoo account; if you had told me that access would require primary <i>and</i> alternate passwords, not primary <i>or</i> alternate, then of course I would have recorded the alternate.</p>

<p>Of course, I know this bad practice is universal among contemporary companies, including even banks, that enable remote access to customer accounts; Yahoo is no exception. I'm writing to you because I have personal experience of being burned in Yahoo's case. Yahoo could become exceptional by being among the first to stop this practice, and thereby put its competitors to shame.</p>

<p>Because the universal bad practice has indoctrinated the general public to expect to use information about themselves as passwords for their accounts, a prudent business decision for now would be to permit your users to continue to do that. But your user-registration process should discourage, not encourage, and certainly not require, the use of such information as passwords. Under the assumption that users will sometimes want to log in using insecure computers, it's wise to allow them to optionally create a recovery password to log in from a more secure system if the primary password is compromised, but you should make it clear that the recovery password is a password, and warn users against using any information about themselves or their family members as that password.</p>

<p>You might say, ‟We need to verify your identity.” But that can't be done using information about your users. The only way to verify a person's identity is face-to-face. Since you never see your email users in person, all you can do is verify that the person trying to log in to an account is the same as (or authorized by) the person who created the account. The only way to do that is by checking his password or using some other such key (asymmetric keys would be ideal, but not necessary). If I had told you what my eldest niece's name is, and somebody used it to log in to my account, you would only be fooling yourself if you said you verified it was me.</p>

<p>Because most of your email users pay you not in the form of money, but in the form of attention (which you then sell to advertisers for money), and knowing about the people whom the attention comes from increases its value, it is good business to ask users for information such as age, sex, marital status, and maybe even whether they have any nieces. That information just isn't suitable for use for account access authorization. Ironically, your use of it that way forces your users to lie to you in order to prevent their accounts from being compromised. Doing authorization properly, and publicizing that you do, not only would be the right thing to do, but also would be profitable.</p>

<p>Since initially writing this message, I've been informed that you now allow users to write their own secret questions, rather than just choose from the canned ones. Because of this, it appears that users who follow the security practitioners' advice might technically now be able to register for Yahoo email addresses without violating your TOS; they can write for example the question ‟What's alternate password #1 I used for Yahoo registration?” and write a randomly-generated password as the answer. This is good, so far as it goes, but it doesn't go nearly far enough; it appears you still use DOB for authorization, you still give the false impression that the questions are for a recovery password, rather than for part of a composite password the entirety of which might be required for access, and you still encourage users to use personal information as passwords, rather than warning them not to do this.</p>

<p>Resolving these issues would be admirable.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
