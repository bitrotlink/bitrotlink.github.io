<p>You wrote an article titled ‟We Austrians Are Shills for the Bankers, Says Critic”, at<br>
http://lewrockwell.com/woods/woods194.html (dead link).</p>

<p>You wrote, ‟Irredeemable paper money could not possibly have emerged this way. It is not a saleable good. No one values pieces of paper with politicians’ faces on them, so they would not be the most marketable commodity in society.”</p>

<p>But the government's fiat money <i>is</i> redeemable. It's redeemable for the privilege to work (America's 16th amendment grants the government the authority to sell this privilege). And most people have voluntarily made these work-privilege tokens the most marketable commodity; it's only forced on the few who object, the force being by laws, such as sales taxes on commodities, that prevent the practical use of competing currencies (which wouldn't be very popular anyway, since almost everybody prefers the work-privilege tokens).</p>

<p>You don't get anything physical, and you might not be able to quickly redeem all of your tokens, but that doesn't mean that they aren't redeemable. If you have coupons for free haircuts, they're still redeemable even though you have no use for them for a while after you're redeemed one. And you can still sell them to people who do have immediate use for them.</p>

<p>‟Moreover, no one can engage in economic calculation using a paper money introduced ex nihilo by the state. With gold (or whatever the spontaneously chosen money commodity happens to be), people can recall the exchange ratios that existed under the latest stage of barter – one gold unit for ten hats, three dozen oranges, or 100 pencils. But with pieces of paper printed by the state and simply imposed on people, how can anyone know how many of them ought to fetch a hat, an orange, or a tomato? Another reason no one would spontaneously adopt this system.”</p>

<p>I assume you mean the problem is that the money is introduced ex nihilo, rather than that it's introduced by the state. Bitcoin disproves your claim; people do spontaneously adopt it and engage in economic calculation using it, even though its nonmonetary value is even less than that of fiat paper money (you can't even use it as toilet paper). It has had major price swings in the past, but that's just because the market is shallow; it doesn't disprove the currency's utility for economic calculation.</p>

<p>And for commodity money, the exchange ratio that existed under the latest stage of barter is irrelevant; people assume continuity of prices, and usually there is continuity, but ultimately ‟The price yesterday is history; the price today is economics” (Thomas Sowell, IIRC), and in particular the transition of a commodity from just a barter item to money will produce discontinuity of prices in terms of that commodity. For example, today you can buy dinner at Olive Garden for an ounce of silver, but can you imagine how many dinners you could buy for an ounce of silver tomorrow if everybody decides to use silver instead of work-privilege tokens as their money? Tomorrow's price might be 10 dinners, or it might be 100 dinners, and today's price would be a useless guide for discovering tomorrow's price.</p>

<p>‟Money emerges in order to lift society out of barter conditions. A situation of multiple monies is a case of partial barter, and thus undermines the very purpose of money. Hence it would gradually give way – as people apprehended the facility with which they could consummate their transactions by using the most marketable commodity as money – to a single, universally accepted money.”</p>

<p>You're assuming that lifting society out of barter conditions is desirable, and necessary in order to facilitate easy consummation of transactions. But consider electronic markets for stocks, commodities, and currencies. People choose which stocks, commodities, and currencies to hold, buy, sell, and take delivery of, without consideration of which currency the goods are priced in terms of. Europeans will typically configure their computers to show commodity prices in euros, and Americans in dollars, regardless of which currency a foreign seller actually wants, and the computers can automatically buy the necessary currency on the spot and immediately use it to buy the foreign goods.</p>

<p>A seller could start pricing his goods in terms of General Motors stock, and nobody would care, or pay attention to GM stock price, or buy GM stock except immediately prior to trading that stock to the aforementioned seller of goods, and the computers could handle the intermediate trades automatically.</p>

<p>Notice the logical conclusion of this: money is pointless. If you have something to sell, you could specify the price not in terms of some monetary commodity, but directly in terms of what you, personally, want. You hold commodities that you, personally, expect to consume. If you have wealth beyond subsistence, then you invest it as usual.</p>

<p>For your convenience in reading prices, you configure your computer to translate everybody's published prices, which could be in terms of numerous stocks and commodities that you don't care about, into terms of whichever stock or commodity you prefer to use as your unit of measurement, and everybody else does likewise.</p>

<p>When you want to buy something, you tell your computer to sell something in exchange (which you have to first deposit into a warehouse that your buyer trusts), and the computer handles the necessary intermediate transactions. There's a cost to such intermediate transactions, but you'd have to make them and pay for them anyway; today, if you have wheat in an American warehouse and you want a Japanese car, you have to sell the wheat for dollars, sell the dollars for yen, and sell the yen for the car, the same as if the intermediaries wanted stuff other than dollars and yen.</p>

<p>Money was necessary in the age before ubiquitous telecommunication. That age is gone. You can buy a mobile phone today, sufficient to also serve as your computer to interface to the electronic markets, for the same price as a wallet to hold your paper money.</p>

<p>Money was also necessary in the age before trustworthy commodity warehouses (trustworthy in terms both of honesty, and of effective defense against attackers, including attackers with badges), trusted widely enough to avoid the need for excessive shuffling of goods among warehouses during electronic transactions. That age might return, but until then, money is pointless.</p>

<p>Not only is money pointless, but it's actually harmful, since it causes price distortion, by building a confidence game focused on some commodity, and amplifies the price swings caused by changes in supply of that commodity. Monetization of a commodity is a symptom of a bottleneck in the exchange process. Communication and secure storage were the historical bottlenecks.</p>

<p>Today's electronic markets happen to defeat privacy, since depositors have accounts, meaning the warehouses record ownership of goods. The system would work just as well using blind signatures instead of accounts, in which case electronic transactions would be just as private as (technically, even more private than) in-person cash transactions with no records at all.</p>

<p>Of course, the men with badges would not be happy about that. That's why they will threaten to come knocking at the warehouses that use blind signatures, which in turn is why nobody can securely store their stuff in such warehouses (which, in order to be widely trusted, must be publicly-identified reputable institutions and therefore vulnerable to the men with badges). The market is non-free because those warehouses are forbidden to sell their services, and ‟know your customer” and ‟money laundering” laws are used to enforce this.</p>

<p>Those warehouses being empty (in fact nonexistent, because potential owners know they would be empty) prevents electronic transactions (nobody will take payment in the form of a claim on the gold that you have buried in your back yard), which is why the only electronic markets that we have today use privacy-defeating accounts, which is why you must pay directly, without warehouse intermediaries, if you want privacy, which is why we must monetize something to facilitate the direct payments. You're right that free markets would de-monetize the work-privilege tokens, but you don't go far enough. Free markets would de-monetize everything.</p>

<p>By the way, that means bitcoins would be demonetized too, and therefore become worthless, because they have no value besides their monetary value. But that's ok, because they would also become unnecessary. The value and necessity of bitcoins today comes from their nature as an electronically privately tradeable commodity that doesn't require physical storage (since the commodity is just secret data) and therefore isn't vulnerable to men with badges, combined with the fact that no physical commodity can be electronically privately traded because the men with badges will attack (and charge with ‟facilitating money laundering”) any warehouse that provides the necessary physical storage.</p>

<p>If markets actually do become free, there's one more minor detail to keep in mind. Listing your prices directly in terms of what you want to buy is most efficient, but that degrades your privacy. If you don't want to publicly announce what you want to buy, then every time you list something for sale, list its price in terms of a randomly selected commodity, accept that commodity as payment, and use it to buy what you actually want. This is marginally less efficient, since an extra transaction is required, but that's the cost you pay for the privacy of de-linking your sales from your purchases. Choosing a random intermediary rather than a standard one prevents monetization of anything, and therefore prevents the harmful effects of monetization.</p>

<p>Although all this sounds complicated, the user interface doesn't have to be. The cashier presses a button on the cash register, the price appears (in terms of whichever commodity you prefer to use for your accounting) on your mobile phone's display, and you press «pay». The rest is automatic. If you're a merchant, you enter prices in terms of your preferred commodity, and the rest is automatic. If your preferred commodity is your government's fiat money, the user interface is the same as the one we have today.</p>
