    <h2>The symbol ⋔ for the ratio of circumference to radius</h2>

    <p>The symbol ⋔ looks similar to Bob Palais's original 3-legged π, and shares with it several advantages over the Greek letter τ:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>more visually conspicuous than τ</li>
      <li>more distinct from other common symbols (τ is similar to the letters t and T)</li>
      <li>visually suggestive that π is half of it</li>
      <li>has no other standard meaning</li>
    </ul>

    <p>⋔ shares with τ some advantages over 3-legged π:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>already present in Unicode (character U+22D4, categorized as a math symbol)</li>
      <li>already present in popular fonts such as the DejaVu family</li>
      <li>writeable by hand using two strokes (even simpler than regular π)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And ⋔ has an advantage over all of τ, regular π, and 3-legged π:</p>
    <p>The glyph is a curve split by a straight line segment, visually suggesting what it represents. It also looks like a turned letter C split by the straight segment, further suggesting C/r. The Greek letters Θ/θ/Φ/φ would be even better, except they're visually too suggestive of diameter specifically, instead of radius. In contrast, ⋔ looks abstract enough to not cause mental coercion to diameter. Besides that, the Greek letters already have other standard meanings.</p>
    <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110103235505/http://www.math.utah.edu/~palais/ConstantFailure-32679.html">Robert Crease</a> used the Greek letter ψ, which shares with ⋔ the advantage of visual suggestiveness, but shares with other Greek letters the disadvantage of already having other standard meanings.</p>
    <p>A mitigating factor for τ and ψ is that symbols with multiple standard meanings can usually be disambiguated by context. But single-meaning symbols are advantageous for clarity.</p>

    <h2>The name <i>srei</i> for the ratio of circumference to radius</h2>
    <p>This rhymes with English <i>ray</i>. It combines the first phoneme of <i>circumference</i> with the first syllable of <i>radius</i> (and of <i>radian</i>, and <i>ratio</i>).</p>
    <p>Like <i>pi</i> is the name for both the letter π and the ratio C/d, <i>srei</i> is the name for both the symbol ⋔ and the ratio C/r.</p>

    <p>Another choice for the name would be <i>ri</i>, analogous to <i>pi</i>. However, English speakers perpetrated the Great Vowel Shift, resulting in <i>pi</i> being pronounced as <i>pai</i> (English <i>pie</i>), instead of <i>pi</i> (English <i>pee</i>) as the Greeks properly pronounce it. Therefore English speakers would correspondingly pronounce <i>ri</i> as <i>rai.</i> We can't undo the Great Vowel Shift, but we can at least abstain from abetting the conspiracy.</p>
    <p>Another choice would be <i>rei</i>, which English speakers properly pronounce the same as <i>ray</i>. But both <i>ri</i> and <i>rei</i> have the problem that when following the word <i>four</i> or <i>over</i>, they sound like only a lone vowel (<i>i</i>, <i>e</i>, or <i>a</i>) since the <i>r</i> sounds run together. The problem is solved by using the name <i>srei</i>.</p>

    <h2>Date notes</h2>
    <p><i>Tau Day</i> proponents celebrate June 28th, due to C/r being approximately 6.28 in decimal. But decimal is a strange choice for people advocating notational improvement for angular measurements, even aside from the fact that June 28th is nowhere near 28 hundredths through the month (that would be June 9th, because 1+⎣30×0.28⎦=9). A more reasonable choice would be <a href="hexal.html">hexal</a>, in which C/r is approximately ๦.๰໽๼.</p>
    <p>Of course, with the symbol being ⋔, the day to celebrate (whatever date it'll be) is <i>Srei Day</i>. Following the Tauists' illogic, the date would be June 16th (with srei in hexal truncated) or 17th (with srei in hexal rounded); alternatively, June 9th is both sensible and independent of the radix, and it's memorable to highschool kids because it makes them giggle.</p>

    <p>Though this is being published just today, the symbol ⋔ has been in private use to mean C/r for more than eleven years. But the name <i>srei</i> was chosen just this year.</p>
